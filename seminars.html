                <h2><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14931">[ArXiv:2208.14931]</a>Impact of magnetic fields on Population III star formation</h2>
                <h3>by <i>Cynthia R. Saad</i> et al.</h3>
                <p>
                    The theory of the formation of the first stars in the Universe, the so-called Population III (Pop III), has until now largely negelected the 
                    impact of magnetic fields. They ascertain how the fragmentation properties of primordial protostellar discs are modified if magneto-hydrodynamic 
                    effects are present. In the present work, they have studied the effect of a magnetic field on the structure and evolution of the discs around
                    Pop III stars inside a cosmological minihalo of \(M_{\mathrm{halo}} = 1.2 \times 10^6 M_\odot \), a virial radius of 130 pc, and a collapse
                    (virializaiton) redshift of \(z \sim 25\).

                    <li>
                        For the runs without magnetic fields (hereafter termed hydro runs), the Piecewise Parabolic Method (PPM) is used.

                    <li>
                        The magnetic field is slowing the collapse. Considering the angular momentum profile, it is evident that the MHD case is particularly 
                        efficient in transporting angular momentum outwards.

                        however, they all adopt a Bayesian approach, instead of a least-square fitting one. This makes the codes simpler and allows for easy inclusion of 
                        priors on galaxy parameters or non-Gaussian uncertainties.

                <h3>by <i>Guillermo Ballesteros</i>et al.</h3>
                <p>
                    They study the generation of a localized peak in the primordial spectrum of curvature perturbations
                    from a transient dissipative phase during inflation, leading to a large population of primordial black holes. The enhancement of the power spectrum
                    occurs due to stochastic thermal noise sourcing curvature fluctuations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In their case, the effect of dissipation on the homegeneous inflaton dynamics can be described under adequate conditions by introducing a dissipative
                    coefficient \(\Gamma\) in its time evolution.
                    $$\ddot{\phi} + (3H+\Gamma)\dot{\phi} + V_\phi = 0$$
                    An enhanced \(\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{R}}\) can arise in a strongly dissipative regime due to a stochastic source for the fluctuations coming from a 
                    thermal bath originating from the couplings between the inflaton and other fields that are also responsible for \(\Gamma\). The perturbation equations 
                    are driven by a source of noise with amplitude \(\sim \sqrt{\Gamma T}\), and so they are significantly enhanced whenever \(\Gamma\) is sufficiently large.
                    The power spectrum of the comoving curvature perturbation is enhanced thanks to the source \(\delta \rho_r\) (whose value is set by the thermal noise)
                    in the equation of motion for \(\delta \phi\).

                <h3>by <i>Tetyana Pitik</i>et al.</h3>

                <p>
                    The centers of the core-collapse supernovae are one of the densest environments in the Universe. Under such conditions, it is conceivable that a 
                    first-order phase transition from ordinary unclear matter to the quark-gluon plasma occurs. This transistion releases a large amount of latent heat
                    that can drive a supernova explosion and may imprint a sharp signature in the neutrino signal. They show how this snap featur, if observed at 
                    large-scale neutrino detectors, can set competitive limits on neutrino masses and assist the localization of the supernova via triangulation.
