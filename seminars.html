                <h3>by <i>Sam M. Ward</i> et al.</h3>
                <p>
                    To improve Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) standardisability, the consistency of distance estimates to siblings - SNe in the same host galaxy - should be 
                    investigated. They build a new hierarchical model that fits light curves of siblings in a single galaxy simultaneously; this yields more precise 
                    estimates of the common distance and the dust parameters, Fitting the trio for a common dust law shape yields \(R_V = 2.62 \pm 0.52\). They estimate 
                    the Hubble constant, using a Cepheid distance to NGC 3147, the siblings trio, and 109 Hubble flow (\(0.01 < z_\mathrm{CMB} < 0.08\)) SNe Ia; marginalising 
                    over the siblings' and population's intrinsic scatters, and the peculiar velocity dispersion, yields \(H_0 = 77.9 \pm 6.5 \mathrm{km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}\).

                <h2><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10552">[ArXiv:2209.10552]</a>Constraining the SN Ia Host Galaxy Dust Law Distribution and Mass Step: Hierarchical BayeSN Analysis of Optical and Near-Infrared Light Curves</h2>
                <h3>by <i>Stephen Thorp</i> and <i>Kaisey S. Mandel</i> </h3>
                <p>
                    They use the BayeSN hierarchical probabilistic SED model to analyse the optical-NIR ( <i>BVriYJH</i> ) light curves of 86 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia)
                    from the Carnegie Supernova Project to investigate the SN Ia host galaxy dust law distribution and correlations between SN Ia Hubble residuals and 
                    host mass. Their Bayesian analysis simultaneously constrains the mass step and dust \(R_V\) population distribution by leveraging optical-NIR colour
                    information. A simplisitc analysis where individual \(R_V\) values are the first estimated for each SN separately, and then sample variance of these 
                    point estimates is computed, overesstimates the \(R_V\) population variance \(\sigma_R^2\). A mass step of \(\gtrsim 0.06\) mag presists in the Hubble 
                    residuals at the median host mass.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like Thorp et al. (2021), they do not find strong evidence for a substantial mass dependence of the \(R_V\) distribution. Although previous works have 
                    found evidence for an anti-correlation between \(R_V\) and reddening or apparent colour, they generally do not find a strong effect of this nature.

                <h3>by <i>James W. Nightingale</i> et al.</h3>
                <p>
                    The cold dark matter (DM) model predicts that every galaxy contains thousands of DM subhalos; almost all other DM models include a physical process that 
                    smooths away the subhalos. The subhalos are invisible, but could be detected via strong gravitational lensing, if they lie on the line of sight to a 
                    multiply-imaged background source, and perturb its apparent shape. An automated strong lens analysis framework.

                <h3>by <i>Aniket Bhagwat</i> et al.</h3>
                <p>
                    They produce mock observations for a set of sightlines for the next generation of telescopes like the ELT and SKA1-LOW, finding that given a sufficiently
                    bright background quasar, these telescopes will be able to detect both types of absorbers throughout reionization.

                <h3>by <i>Vo Hong Minh Phan</i> et al.</h3>
                <p>
                    Cosmic rays are the only agent able to penetrate into the interior of dense molecular clouds. Cosmic rays play an essential role in determining the 
                    physical and chemical evolution of star-forming regions. They model the distribution of low-energy cosmic-ray spectra expected from a statistical 
                    population of supernova remnants in the Milky Way. They find that the stochastic uncertainty helps with explaining the surprisingly high ionization 
                    rates observed in many molecular clouds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even if we take into account the stochasticity of the ionization rate, the soure density in local ISM (LOC point) is still not sufficient to explain
                    the observed data.
