                <h3>by <i>Vasily Belokurov</i> and <i>N. Wyn Evans</i></h3>
                <p>
                    Early-type dwarfs (ETDs) are the end points of the evolution of low-mass galaxies whose gas supply has been extinguished. The primeval stellar 
                    populations in the ETDs provide a unique laboratory to study the physical conditions on small scales at epoch beyond \(z = 2\).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Connection between early and late-type dwarfs
                    <li>
                    ETDs are simple in appearance: they (usually) have spheroidal shapes and smooth stellar light distributions, lack large quantities of hydrogen and 
                    do not show any recent star formation (SF) activity.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The dichotomy of <i>late-time</i> and <i>early-type</i> dwarfs is thus, just like that of the more massive galaxies, to do with the distinction 
                        between <i>life</i>, i.e. active conversion of gas into stars and the associated chemical enrichment and feed back, and <i>death</i>, i.e. shutting 
                        down of SF and subsequent collisionless relaxation driven by gravity alone.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The ETDs are simply the lifeless descendants of the LTDs。
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The intimate connection between the two types of dwarfs galaxies is revealed by the continuity of their structural properties. The link is less 
                        perceptible around the Milky Way due to the dominance of quenched dwarfs (without gas and no evidence of recent SF).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Most ETDs probably started off irregularly shaped, whilst the more massive ones were rotating discs.

                <p>
                    MAXI J1820+070 is a low-mass X-ray binary with a black hole as a compact object. This binary underwent an exceptionally bright X-ray outburst from March to
                    October 2018, showing evidence of a non-thermal particle population through its radio emission during this whole period. The observations reported in this 
                    work do not show any significant emission in either HE or VHE gamma rays, regardless of the source state.

                            It is naturally intertwined with the neutrino frontier, as \(\sim\)keV-scale sterile neutrinos would be connected to the active neutrinos through
                            e.g. the see-saw mechanism.

                            The present-day primordial baryon asymmetry is quantified precisely through big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) and CMB analyses to \(\eta_B = 
                            (n_b - n_{\bar{b}})/n_\gamma = n_b / n_\gamma = (6.10 \pm 0.4) \times 10^{-10} \).

                            Axions are light, bosonic particles that are part of a broader class of possible new physics candidates that includes dark photons and scalars,
                            which could also be DM candidates.

                            Scalars and dark photons, especially in the context of wave-like DM, have also seen enormous theoretical progress over the past decade and also 
                            have compelling ultraviolet and phenomenological motivations.

                            QCD coupled to massive quarks has a CP-violating angle \(\bar{\theta}\) that generates a neutron electric dipole moment (EDM): \(d_n \sim 10 ^{-16} \mathrm{e \cdot cm}\).
                            However, direct searches for the neutron EDM have yet to yield a non-zero value, constraining \(|d_n| \lesssim 3 \times 10^{-26} \mathrm{e \cdot cm}\), which implies
                            that \( |\bar{\theta}| \lesssim 10^{-10}\). CP and P are not restored as symmetries of the SM if \(\bar{\theta} = 0\), making symmetry-based solutions to the 
                            strong-CP problem difficult.

                            The production mechamism for QCD axion DM depends crucially on the ordering of inflation relative to PQ symmetry breaking.

                            Axion-like particles, which do not couple to QCD but have small bare masses or small masses from confining dark sectors, may also make up a sizeable fraction of the DM.

                            Fuzzy DM may also reduce the dynamical friction that objects feel in DM halo.
