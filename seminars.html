                <h3>by <i>Garðar Sigurðarson</i> et al.</h3>
                <p>
                    The existence of eV-mass sterile neutrinos is not ruled out because of persistent experimental anomalies. Upcoming multi-messenger detections of 
                    neutron-star merger remnants could provide indirect constraints on the existence of these particles. Their findings imply that the production of 
                    sterile stars can have indirect implications on the disk cooling rate, its outflows, and related electromagnetic observables which remain to be asssessed.

                <h3>by <i>Sara L. Ellison</i> et al.</h3>
                <p>
                    Galaxy mergers trigger both star formation and accertion onto the central supermassive black hole. As a result of subsequent energetic feedback processes, 
                    it has long been proposed that star formation may be promptly extinguished in galaxy merger remnants. Based on a sample of \(\sim 500\) identified from the 
                    Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS), they show that the frequency of post-merger galaxies that have rapidly shutdown their star formation 
                    following a previous starburst is 30-60 times higher than expected from a control sample of non-merging galaxies. No such excess is found in a sample of close 
                    galaxy pairs, demonstrating that mergers can indeed lead to a rapid halt to star formation, but that this process only manifests after coalescence.

                            QCD coupled to massive quarks has a CP-violating angle \(\bar{\theta}\) that generates a neutron electric dipole moment (EDM): \(d_n \sim 10 ^{-16} \mathrm{e \cdot cm}\).
                            However, direct searches for the neutron EDM have yet to yield a non-zero value, constraining \(|d_n| \lesssim 3 \times 10^{-26} \mathrm{e \cdot cm}\), which implies
                            that \( |\bar{\theta}| \lesssim 10^{-10}\). CP and P are not restored as symmetries of the SM if \(\bar{\theta} = 0\), making symmetry-based solutions to the 
                            strong-CP problem difficult.

                            Axion-like particles, which do not couple to QCD but have small bare masses or small masses from confining dark sectors, may also make up a sizeable fraction of the DM.
