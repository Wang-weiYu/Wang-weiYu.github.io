                    They clarify the sense in which quantum field theory can continue to be well defined even though the extended space-time is not globally hyperbolic

                <p>
                    Recent measurements of the cosmic X-ray and radio backgrounds (CXB/CRB, respectively) obtianed with Chandra and ARCADE2 report signals in excess of 
                    those expected from known sources, suggesting the presence of a yet undiscovered population of emiiters. The emission from PBHs accreting in the 
                    IGM is subdominant at all times. Most of the CXB/CRB emission comes from PBHs in DM mini-halos at early epochs (\(z > 6\)). Their results set the 
                    strongest existing constraint on \(f_\mathrm{PBH} \leq 3 \times 10^{-4} (30/ M_\mathrm{PBH})\) in the mass range 1 - 1000 \(M_\odot\).

                <p>
                    The total mass fraction in GCs is relatively high, supporting an overmassive dark matter as also implied by the high velocity dispersion previously 
                    measured. The nature and origin of this galaxy remain puzzling, but the most likely scenario is a ``failed galaxy'' that formed relatively few 
                    stars for its halo mass, and could be related to cluster UDGs whose size and quiescence pre-date their infall.

                    clockwise orbital motion of a hot spot embedded in a magnetic field dominated by a dynamically important vertical component, oberved at a low inclination ~ \( 20^\circ\).
                    The observe hints of a positive black hole spin. The accretion structrue in Sgr A* might be a magnetically arrested disk rotating clockwise.

                        Aat any redshift, BAT detects the most luminous blazars, above any possible break in their luminosity distribution, which means we cannot

                            Scalars and dark photons, especially in the context of wave-like DM, have also seen enormous theoretical progress over the past decade and also 
                            have compelling ultraviolet and phenomenological motivations.

                            QCD coupled to massive quarks has a CP-violating angle \(\bar{\theta}\) that generates a neutron electric dipole moment (EDM): \(d_n \sim 10 ^{-16} \mathrm{e \cdot cm}\).
                            However, direct searches for the neutron EDM have yet to yield a non-zero value, constraining \(|d_n| \lesssim 3 \times 10^{-26} \mathrm{e \cdot cm}\), which implies
                            that \( |\bar{\theta}| \lesssim 10^{-10}\). CP and P are not restored as symmetries of the SM if \(\bar{\theta} = 0\), making symmetry-based solutions to the 
                            strong-CP problem difficult.

                            The production mechamism for QCD axion DM depends crucially on the ordering of inflation relative to PQ symmetry breaking.

                            Axion-like particles, which do not couple to QCD but have small bare masses or small masses from confining dark sectors, may also make up a sizeable fraction of the DM.

                            Local non-Gaussianity, parameterized by \(f_{\mathrm{NL}}^{\mathrm{loc}}\), arises in multi-field infaltion
