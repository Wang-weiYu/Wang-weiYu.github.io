                <h2><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01113">[ArXiv:2209.01113]</a>Neural Network Reconstruction of H′(z) and its application in Teleparallel Gravity</h2>
                <h3>by <i>Purba Mukherjee</i> et al.</h3>

                <p>
                    One of the aims of proposing this new approach to reconstructing the Hubble derivative \(H'(z)\) is to be more conpetitive with the applications of Guassian processes.
                    One main application is the reconstruction of dark energy within modified theories of gravity. 
                    They exolore the possibility of using artificial neural networks to impose constraints on teleparalllel gravity and its \(f(T)\) extensions. They us the 
                    avaiblable Hubble parameter observations from cosmic chronometers and baryon acoustic oscillations from different galaxy surveys. Results show that the \(\Lambda\)CDM
                    model lies comfortably included at the 1\(\sigma\) confidence level for all the examined cases. They have shown the reconstruction of the Hubble 
                    derivative \(H'(z)\) can be constructed using a combination of ANNs and Monte-Carlo (MC) approach. This allows them to propose a new approach by which to perform the
                    constructions of dark energy replacing Guassian processes with ANNs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The approach which ANNs rely on is altogether different from that of GPs where the over-fitting and kernel selection issus has been largely replaced by the 
                    large size of the neuron system which learns how to mimic the observational data in a more natural way.

                <h2><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00903">[ArXiv:2209.00903]</a>Barrow holographic dark energy in the Brans-Dicke cosmology</h2>
                <h3>by <i>S.Ghaffari</i> et al.</h3>

                <p>
                    They construct a holographic model for dark energy in Brans-Dicke cosmology by using the holographic principle considering the Barrow entropy 
                    instead of the standard Bekenstein-Hawking one.

                <h2><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00681">[ArXiv:2209.00681]</a>The flickering radio jet from the quiescent black hole X-ray binary A0620-00</h2>
                <h3>by <i>Donna L. dePolo</i> et al.</h3>

                <p>
                    Jet variability can lead to misclassification of accreting compact objects in quiescence, and affects the detectability of black hole X-ray binaries 
                    in next-generation radio surveys. Given that V404 Cyg has a jet radio lumonisoty \(\sim 20\) times higher than A0620-00, this comparison could 
                    suggest that less luminous jets are less variable in quiescence.

                <h2><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01007">[ArXiv:2209.01007]</a>Mass loss and the Eddington parameter</h2>
                <h3>by <i>Joachim M. Bestenlehner</i></h3>
                
                <p>
                    Mass loss through stellar winds plays a dominant role in evolution of massive stars. Very massive stars (>100 \(M_\odot\)) display Wolf-Rayet 
                    spectral morphotogies (WNh) whilst on the main-squence. Bestenlehner (2020) extended the elegant and widely used stellar wind theory by 
                    Castor, Abbott & Klein from the optically thin (O star) to the optically thick thin (O star) to the optically thick main-squence wind regime. The new 
                    mass-loss description is able the empirical mass-loss dependence on the Eddington parameter and is suitable for incorporation into stellar evolution models
                    for massive and very massive stars. Based on the stellar sample presented in Bestenlehner et al. (2014) we derive a mass-loss recipe for the Large Magellanic
                    Cloud using the new theoretical mass-loss prescription of Bestenlehner (2020).

                        Wolf–Rayet stars, are a rare heterogeneous set of stars with unusual spectra showing prominent broad lines of instead of ionised heilum and highly ionised 
                        nitrogen or carbon. They spectra indicate very high surface enhancement of heavy elements, depletion of hydrogen, and strong stellar winds.
