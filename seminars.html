                <h3>by <i>Xuheng Ding</i> et al.</h3>
                <p>
                    They measure the host galaxy properties of five quasar with \(z \sim 1.6 - 3.5\) selected from SDSS and AEGID, which fall whithin the JWST/HST 
                    CEERS survey area. Overall, they find quasar hosts to be disk-like, lack merger signatures, and have sizes generally more compact than typical 
                    star-forming galaxies at their respectvie stellar, thus in agreement with results at lower redshifts. They constructed a PSF library from stars 
                    within each field-of-view for every filter. With multi-band photometry of the host, they performed SED fitting to infer the properties of the stellar 
                    population, including stellar mass, age, and star formation rate.

                <p>
                    The lack of bright supernovae sules out typical core-collapse explosion, but their distance scales prevent sensitive searches for direct sigatures 
                    of a progenitor system. Only tentative evidence for a kilonova has been presented. Here they report observations of the exceptionally bright GRB211211A 
                    that classify it as a hybrid event and constrain its distance scale to only 346 Mpc. The GRB does not lie in a star-forming region (Methods) and 
                    late-time optical imaging rules out any bright supernova at its location. The GRB location and the global properties of its host galaxy provide 
                    indirect evidence for a stellar progenitor different from a collapsing massive star and are instead consistent with a binary NS merger (Methods).

                <h3>by <i>Richard J. Parker</i> and <i>Emma C. Daffern-Powell</i> </h3>
                <p>
                    They use N-body simulations of star-forming regions to show that these systems can instead form the capture of a free-floating planet, or the direct 
                    theft of a planet from one star to another, more massive star. They find that this occurs on average once in the first 10 Myr of an assocaition's evolution,
                    and that the semimajor axes of the hitherto confirmed BEAST planets (290 and 556 au) are more consistent with capture than theft. They results lend further 
                    credence to the notion that planets on more distant (>100 au) orbis may not be orbiting their parent star.

                        B-type stars are very luminous and blue. Their spectra have neutral helium lines, which are most prominent at the B2 subclass, and moderate hydrogen lines. As O- and B-type stars are so energetic, they only live for a relatively short time. Thus, due to the low probability of kinematic interaction during their lifetime, they are unable to stray far from the area in which they formed, apart from runaway stars. - wiki

                <h2><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03385">[ArXiv:2209.03385]</a>The locations of features in the mass distribution of merging binary black holes are robust against uncertainties in the metallicity-dependent cosmic star formation history</h2>
                <h3>by <i>L. A. C. van Son</i> et al.</h3>
                <p>
                    They propose a simple analytical function for cosmic star formation history. They fit their analytical function to the star-forming gas of the 
                    cosmological TNG100 simulation and find that it is able to capture the main behaviour well. Their main findingsare : I) the locations of features 
                    are remarkably robust against variations in the metallicity-dependent cosmic star formation history, and II) the low mass end is least affected by
                    these variations. This is promising as it increases our chances to constrain the physics that governs the formation of these objects.

                    <li>
                        The locations of features in the distribution of primary BH masses are robust against variations in cosmic star formation history. The location 
                        of features in the mass distribution of BHs could thus be used as sign posts of their formation channel.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For all variations, the low mass end of the mass distribution is least influenced by changes in the formation history. This because the lowest 
                        mass BHs can be formed from all metallicities above \(z \gtrsim 10^{-3}\), for which the star fomation rate is relatively well constrained in 
                        the recent Universe. THis suggests that the lower end of the BH mass distribution (component masses \(leq 15 M_\odot\)) is potentially very powerful
                        for constraining the physics of the formation channels, irrespective of the cosmic star fomation rate uncertainties.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The metallicity distribution of star formation at low redshift primarily impacts the normalisation of the BBH merger rate. Changing the overall starmation rage density
                        also affects the rate, but to a lesser degree. Low-metallicity star formation at low redshifts dominates the overall normalisation of the BBH merger rate.

                    <li>
                        Parameters that influence the redshift evolution of the mean and the width of the metallicity distribution affect the slope of the high mass end of the primary BH mass 
                        distribution for the stable channel. This affects the longer delay times of the stable channel with respect to the CE channel.
