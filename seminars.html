                    It is commonly assumed that the stochastic background of gravitational waves on cosmological scales follows an almost scale-independent power
                    spectrum, as generically predicted by the inflationary paradigm. They do not find any evidence for the existence of bump-like tensor features
                    at present, but demonstrate that future CMB experiments such as LiteBIRD and CMBS4 will greatly improve their prospects of determining the amplitude, 
                    location and width of such a bump.

                <p>
                    Gravitational waves travel through the distributions of matter and dark energy during propagation. They suggest a formultion for higher-order 
                    correlations of the geometrical optics expansion, applied to Horndeski theory which accommodates many dark energy models. They anallyze the 
                    equations of motion for scalar and tensor components of gravitational waves at the leading and next-to-leading oder in the geometrical optics
                    expansion, deriving the evolution equations for their amplitudes under certain conditions. To study the phenomenology of the propagation of the

                <h3>by <i>I. Yu. Rybak</i> and <i>L. Sousa</i> </h3>
                <p>
                    They study the gravitational radiation emission efficiency \(\Gamma\) of superconducting cosmic strings. By using a solvable model of transonic strings,
                    that the presence of a current leads to a suppression of the gravitational emission of cusps, kinks and different types of loops. They establish a 
                    phenomenological relationship between \(\Gamma\) and the value of current on the stochastic gravitational wave background generated by cosmic strings 
                    with additional degrees of freedom and show that both the amplitude and shape of the spectrum may be significantly affected.

                <p>
                    They propose a new scenario of early dark energy (EDE) with dark Higgs trapped at the origin. They us dark photons produced non-thermally by coherent
                    oscillations of axions, which have a much stronger trapping effect than thermal mass. When the trapping ends, the dark Higgs quickly decays into dark 
                    photons, which are then red-shift as radiation. They find the viable parameter region of the axion decay constant and the axion mass where dark matter and 
                    the \(H_0\) tension can be simultaneously explained.

                <h3>by <i>Kalin V. Staykov</i> and <i>Daniela D. Doneva</i> </h3>
                <p>
                    A new nonlinear mechanism for black hole scalarization, different from the standard spontaneous scalarization, was demonstrated to exist for scalar 
                    Gauss-Bonnet theories in which no tachyonic instabilities can occur. The Schwarzschild black hole is linearly stable but instead nonlinear instability 
                    can kick-in. They extend on this idea in the case of multi-scalar Gauss-Bonnet gravity with exponential coupling functions of third and fourth leading
                    order in the scalar field. They demonstrate numerically the existence of scalarized black holes for both coupling funcitons and for all possible 
                    maximally symmetic scalar field target spaces. They demonstrated the existence of the rencently discovered mechanism for nonlinear scalarization in 
                    multi-scalar Gauss-Bonnet (MSGB) gravity, extending previous results in the single scalar field theory.
