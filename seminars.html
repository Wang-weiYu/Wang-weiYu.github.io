                <h2><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14088">[ArXiv:2208.14088]</a>The challenge of ruling out inflation via the primordial graviton background
                </h2>
    <h3>by <i>Sunny Vagnozzi</i> and <i>Abraham Loeb</i> </h3>
    <p>
        They argue that a detection of the Cosmic Graviton Background (CGB), the relic radiation from gravitons decoupling around the Planck time, would rule out the
        inflationary paradigm, as realistic inflationary models would dilute the CGB to an unobservable level. The CGB contribution to the effective number of relativistic
        species, \(\Delta N_{\mathrm{eff},g} \approx 0.054 \), is within the reach of next-generation cosmological probes. They argue that detecting the high-frequency 
        stochastic gravitational wave background wave background associated to the CGB will be challenging but potentially feasible.
    </p>

    <p>
        An inflationary phase taking place between the Planck era and today would wash out the CGB, rendering it unobservable: an unambiguous CGB detection would
        therefore pose a major threat to the inflatonay paradigm.
    </p>

    <p>
        <li>
            Adopt the working assumption that above the Planck scale point-like four-particle interactions involving two gravitons, whose rate at temperature T is of
            order \(\Gamma_g \sim T^5 / M_{\mathrm{Pl}^4} \), kept gravitons in thermal equilibrium in the primordial plasma. <a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0370269309010764">Detecting relics of a thermal gravitational wave background in the early Universe</a>

        </li>

        <li>
            Under these minimal assumptions the present-day CGB temperature is preficted to be \(T_{g,0} \simeq (3.91/106.75)^{1/3} T_{\gamma,0} \approx 0.9 K\),
            making the CGB 3 times colder than the CMB.

    <h3>by <i>Jing Liu</i> et al.</h3>

    <p>
        They investigate the curvature perturbations induced by the randomness of the quantum tunneling process during cosmological first-order phase transition (PTs)
        and for the first time ultilize curvature perturbations to constrain the PT parameters. This work gives strict constraints on \(\alpha \) and \(\beta / H_*\)
        for the PT temperature below 100GeV, including dark PTs, QCD first-order PTs and electroweak first-order PTs.

    <h3>by <i>Matteo Califano</i> et al.</h3>

    <p>
        They demonstrate that the Einstein Telescope is capable of acheiving a relative accuracy below 1% on the Hubble constant independently of specific dark
        energy model. They first build mock catalogs containing gravitational wave events for one, five and ten years of observations, and above Signal-to-Noise 
        Ratio equal to nine. They foresee that the Hubble constant is always constrained with less than 1% uncertainty, thereby offering a potential solution to 
        the Hubble tension.

    <h3>by <i>Huanqing Chen</i> et al.</h3>

    <p>
        In this work, they demonstrate a method based on a convolutional neutral network to recover the spatial porfile for T0, the temperature at the mean cosmic
        density, in quasar proximity zones. They train the neural network with synthetic spectra drawn from a Cosmic Reionization on Computers simulation. Using the 
        method, one could distinguish whether gas is inside or outside the HeIII region created by the quasar. Because the size of the HeIII region is closely related
        to the total quasar lifetime, this method has great potential in constraining the quasar lifetime on ~ Myr timescales.

            Our test indicates that at distance > 3 pMpc from the

            simple CNN presented in this paper and may require more complex

    <h3>by <i>Kai Hendriks</i> et al.</h3>

    <p>
        They construct a model for sGRBs and add this to the framework of the previously-built Gravitational Wave
        Universe Toolbox (GWToolbox or Toolbox).

        Method: They employ and adapt a generic GRB model to create a computationally low-cost top-hat jet model suitable for the

        our model predicts the properties of a resulting sGRB, as well as its detectability for HE detectors such as Fermi/GBM, Swift/BAT or
        GECAM.
