                <p>
                    In this paper, they consider the possible effect of the teleparallel gravity on the production of the primordial black holes (PBH) and on the gravitational 
                    waves (GWs). They find that the PBH overproduction can be satisfied for specific values of parameters of the non-adiabatic curvature power spectrum at

                <p>
                    They perform an analytical study of the stability of th background solution of the model in which an inflaton, through an axionic coupling to a \(U(1)\)
                    gauge field, causes an amplification of the gauge field modes that strongly backreact on its dynamics. As long as the system is in the strong backreaction 
                    regime they find that the inflaton velocity performs oscillations of increasing amplitude about the value it would have in mean field approximation, 
                    confirming an instability that has been observed in numerical studies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The instability is present irrespective of the choice of parameters in the model, as long as one is in the strong backreaction regime. -- not consider spatial
                    fluctuations in the inflaton field.

                <p>
                    They use a catalogue of stellar binaries with wide separations (up to 1 pc) identified by the \textit{Gaia} satellite to constrain the presence of 
                    extended substructure within the Milky Way galaxy. Constraints weaken for subhalos with larger length scales and are dependent on their density 
                    profiles. For such large subhalos, higher central densities lead to stronger constraints. Subhalos with density profiles similar to these expected 
                    from cold dark matter must be at least \(\sim\) 5,000 times denser than predicted by simulation to be constrained by the wide binary catalogue.

                            QCD coupled to massive quarks has a CP-violating angle \(\bar{\theta}\) that generates a neutron electric dipole moment (EDM): \(d_n \sim 10 ^{-16} \mathrm{e \cdot cm}\).
                            However, direct searches for the neutron EDM have yet to yield a non-zero value, constraining \(|d_n| \lesssim 3 \times 10^{-26} \mathrm{e \cdot cm}\), which implies
                            that \( |\bar{\theta}| \lesssim 10^{-10}\). CP and P are not restored as symmetries of the SM if \(\bar{\theta} = 0\), making symmetry-based solutions to the 
                            strong-CP problem difficult.

                            Axion-like particles, which do not couple to QCD but have small bare masses or small masses from confining dark sectors, may also make up a sizeable fraction of the DM.
