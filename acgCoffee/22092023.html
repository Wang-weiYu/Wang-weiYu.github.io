        <h2><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10903">[ArXiv:2309.10903]</a>Constraining the time evolution of the propagation speed of gravitational waves with multimessenger astronmy</h2>
        <h3>by<i>Antonio Enea Romano, Mairi Sakellariadou</i> et al. </h3>
        <p>
            Several modified gravity theories could be possible to be tested with multimessenger astronomy. More directly, we need multimessenger astronomy to get the precise location of single GWs source. As we have located the GWs source, we can get the Hubble Constant. For example, the well-known GW170817:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01183">[arXiv:2103.01183]</a>by Abbott B P et al. use the both gravitational waves and electromagnetic waves together from GW170817 and gave us \( H_0 = 70.0_{-8.0}^{+12.0} km/s/Mpc \).
    <li>
      <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08627">[arXiv:1909.08627]</a>by Suvodip Mukherjee et al. get a more accurate peculiar velocity and get \(H_0 = 68.3^{+4.6}_{-4.5} km/s/Mpc\). In short, by getting a more accurate estimation of the cosmological redshift, the paper give us a better accuracy. <li>
          <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10596">[arXiv:1806.10596]</a>by Kenta Hotokezaka et al. get the more information about the jet in GW170817 and combined with previous GW and EW data, they get a significantly improved measurement \(H_0 = 68.9^{+4.7}_{-4.6}\). <li>
</ul>
About the measurement of the Hubble Constant, I want to talk more about using the GWs to measure the Hubble Constant. The GW170817 we talked before, is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_distance_ladder#Standard_siren">Standard siren</a> (maybe it can be called the bright siren?) for we can allocating its distance from our earth. In the contrast, we have the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_siren">Dark siren</a>. Because many GWs sources donnot have electromagnetic counterparts observation, we only use the statistical method to allocate them. The idea was first-proposed by Bernard F.Schutz in 1986 in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/323310a0">Determining the Hubble constant from gravitational waves</a>. However, for the not so good location (just for now!), it can only give us <a href="https://www.arxiv.org/abs/1901.01540">[arXiv:1901.01540]</a> \(H_0 = 75.2^{+39.5}_{-32.4} km/s/Mpc\). However, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14732">[arXiv:2010.14732]</a> prove the dark siren precision could be up to \(1 %\) by LISA-Taiji network.

           In the paper, they propose using the relation between the time delay and the GW-EMW speed difference, which could know information beyond the GR. As we know, in GR, there is no difference of velocity between GWs and EMW. However, if we consider the case beyond GR, for example, modified gravity, like scalar-Tensor theory, f(R) gravity, f(T) gravity, MONO, extra dimensions and so on. The speed of the two kinds waves are different. Most interestingly, which is faster could be uncertain in a specific theory. For example, with the help of extra dimensions, the GWs could run faster than EMW for the shortcut or run slower for the more distance. Anywhere, if we want the speed of the two waves are different, we must consider the gravity theory beyond GR.

            In other words, if we detect the derivation to light speed  in GWs, we could find the evidence of deriving GR.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of cause, in PTA we interested, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02640">[arxiv:2304.02640]</a> propose modified gravity could be detected by PTA. The HD curve could be effected. However, the modified gravity also could effect the systematic error, which is most headache!
